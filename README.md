# How do I approach designing software?
    - What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
      My work on this project helped me break objects down into the triangles then vertices required to create them in a graphics environment. It has helped me think of different ways to break things down into smaller portions.
    
    - What design process did you follow for your project work?
      I chose to break large tasks down into smaller, more manageable tasks in order to accomplish my goals on time.
    
    - How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
      The tactic of breaking tasks up into smaller ones and then breaking those ones into even smaller, more manageable ones in order to keep the project on track. 
    

# How do I approach developing programs?
    - What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
      While working on my 3D scene, I broke it up into sections for me to work on each day. Some of those were creating each object, adding textures, transformations, lighting, etc. 
    
    - How did iteration factor into your development?
      It factored into my development as I created each object then refined and fine tuned them to ensure they look how they're supposed to.
    
    - How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
      It evolved by once again breaking it up into smaller tasks, which made the stress much lower and the workload much more manageable.
    

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
      It gives me basic knowledge of the graphics pipeline and how graphics works. These could be applied in a more advanced graphics course.
    
    - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
      It gives me basic knowledge of the graphics pipeline and how graphics works. These could be applied in my possible future as a game developer.
